# LLVM Boilerplate for Java [![](https://jitpack.io/v/happyzleaf/llvm-boilerplate.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#happyzleaf/llvm-boilerplate)
Based off of [voidlang](https://github.com/VoidLang/void)'s LLVM wrapper.
<br>And by that I mean they wrote everything and I made it into a dependency.

## Usage
Import this library using [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#happyzleaf/llvm-boilerplate).

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://jitpack.io'
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.happyzleaf:llvm-boilerplate:1.0.1'
}
```

## Example
